	<p>
		Shippingsoon is a free and open source content management system I designed in 2012 to host my freelance work and software projects. In 2014 it was redesigned from scratch with Codeigniter, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like most of my open source endeavours Shippingsoon will remain in perpetual development until it reflects the best programming
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices" target="_blank">practices</a> and
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles" target="_blank">principles</a>.
		Considering the fact that technology standards are constantly changing and new practices are being published each day, development on Shippingsoon will never end.

		Most <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/busy" title="Busy" data-toggle="tooltip">self</a>-<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lazy" title="Lazy">respecting</a> developers would just grab a WordPress template for their personal website and call it a day, but I am no ordinary developer.
		Feel free to fork the source code or play around with our fancy <a href="https://www.shippingsoon.com/user/login"> login terminal</a>. Shippingsoon would never have happened without the help of <a href="https://www.shippingsoon.com/about/credits">these open source projects</a>.

			Each page is built with a responsive design. <b>Try</b> resizing your web browser's window to see it in action.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <a href="portfolio/search/0/12/code">search page</a> was coded with HTML5 pushstate and AJAX for a modern search experience.
		</li>
		<li>
			Shippingsoon's Model View Controller design pattern allows for the codebase to be easily maintained and refined.

			For <strong>SEO</strong> (Search Engine Optimization): 
			<ul>
				<li>I routed URL segments to make them smaller (and ordered by relevance).</li>
				<li>Each page title/description is unique.</li>
				<li>H1 and <strong>strong tags</strong> were used in moderation.</li>
				<li>Every article has search tags</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Each line of code was written with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in mind. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Did I mention that each page is <a href="http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shippingsoon.com%2F" target="_blank">valid HTML5</a> with <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/writing-efficient-css-selectors/" target="_blank">efficient CSS</a> selectors.
